#lasercut-delta

## Intro

This repo contains a design for 3D a delta-stlye printer, largely built from laser-cut parts. The motivation being a fast-to create printer, accessible to anyone with access to a laser cutter.

## Editing

All files are authored using [QCad](http://www.qcad.org/en/) which has proven to work really well for this kind of 2D editing

## Contents
The printer is a conventional delta layout. Under active development. Either toothed belt or spectra fishing line can be used

##Arms
Both designs are intended to use magnetic balls glued to the effector and carriages, with bolts in aluminium tubing acting as the arms. 

##Status
Currently the body parts and some bearing carriages are cut and assembled. The next step is to finish the bearing carriages and assemble the effector.
